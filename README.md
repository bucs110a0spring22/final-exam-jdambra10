## SUMMARY:
Please make sure you have completed the soot survey at:
    [soot.binghamton.edu](https://soot.binghamton.edu)

Please list the urls for the APIs you used:

Summary of Program:
ACNH API:
Asks if the user wants to use today's date or their own (or someone else's) birthday and then loops through the API to check every single villager in the game to see who shares a birthday with the given date

DnD5e API:
DnD5e character generator! First asks the user if they would like to play EITHER a certain class, race, or background and then asks what their preference is. Will then generate the other attributes and prints them out to the user for them to use and potentially make a character around.

If no preference for any attribute, will fully randomize a class, race, and background for the user.

Useful to help stoke creativity by giving the player specific attributes and "forcing" them to work around potentially conflicting combinations to make creative and compelling characters

Most Challenging topic in the course:
Learning all the methods for outside libraries such as pygame for the final project

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
 < What parts of the project you were not able to complete >
 I completed what I wanted to

## REFERENCES:
 < List any outside resources used >

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
 < Anything you would like the grader to know >
 Unfortunately, the ACNH birthday loop takes a really long time and is pre-commented out as to not waste time unless you deliberately want to run the method.
